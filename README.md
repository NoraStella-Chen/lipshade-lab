# Lipshade Lab - Lipstick Recommendation System

Lipshade Lab is an interactive web application that helps users find the perfect lipstick shades based on their skin tone. The system takes user input either through automatic skin tone detection (via Google Mediapipe by uploaded image) or manual skin tone selection. The application recommends lipstick shades based on expert suggestions, user reviews, and color clustering.

This repository contains the code to run the lipstick recommendation system using Streamlit. It also provides the necessary scripts to handle data collection, preprocessing, and recommendation logic.
